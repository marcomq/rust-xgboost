## Content
These binary libs have been copied from existing repos, using version 3.0.0 of xgboost and then uploaded here.
They have been created for convenience and because homebrew isn't able to download a specific version. 
The selection was fine for our developers - we currently don't need to add other binaries.

Source:
- linux_amd64: homebrew installed via curl, xgboost 3.0.0, debian 12, amd64 docker container
- mac_arm64: homebebrew installed via curl, xgboost 3.0.0, Sequioa 15.3, arm64
- win_amd64: pip, python 3.13, Visua Studio 2022 to create .lib
